Hey there, I’m Sujal Sanjay Chhajed! 👋
I’m a sports junkie, movie lover, and proud foodie with a deep passion for all things tech. Currently, I’m studying Computer Science & Engineering (with a sprinkle of AI & ML) at VIT Chennai—trying to mix creativity with code one project at a time.

A Little About Me
Sports & F1 Fanatic:
Whether it’s the roar of the crowd at a game or the high-octane excitement of Formula 1, I’m all in. I love the strategy, skill, and passion behind every match and race.

Movie & Web Series Enthusiast:
I’m not one for endless binging, but I always make time for a great story. Movies and shows inspire me, and sometimes even sneak in a cool idea or two for my projects.

Foodie by Birth and Heart:
I take my food seriously—from street eats to gourmet treats, every bite is a new adventure. After a hard day of coding, there’s nothing like exploring a new dish or a cozy food joint.

Tech Nerd with a Human Touch:
I might be deep in the world of coding and tech, but I firmly believe that staying human and curious is what drives innovation. I’m all about building things that matter while enjoying the simple pleasures in life.
